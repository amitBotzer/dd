# DD
Automatic estimation tool for research and development tasks

One of the most challenging tasks of a technical manager is to estimate how long would some task take for some developer/researcher. There are some heuristic methodologies out there, but the estimation of software/research task duration is still mostly based on guts feeling.

DD is meant to solve this problem using data. By collectiong enough data on past tasks and their real durations, DD uses statistical models to predict how long would the task take. Moreover, DD might ask some interogative questions before giving an estimation, such as "With how many people the doer must interact to do this task?" or "Is the programmer who originally wrote the code is still prescense?". Those questions might raise indicators that the manager didn't thing of.
